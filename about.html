                    <p class="firsthome1"> Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta "Lady Gaga" was born on March 28, 1986, in New York City to Cynthia Louise and Joseph Germanotta. She began playing the piano at the age of 4. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart.
                        Gaga described herself in school as, "... a misfit among her peers." The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative
                        Arts Camp. She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

                    <p class="firsthome1"> In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21
                        at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Artsâ€”and lived in an NYU dorm. At NYU, she studied music and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics. During the second
                        semester of her sophomore year in 2005, she withdrew to focus on her music.

                        In March 2018, Gaga supported a gun-control rally in Washington DC and released a cover of Elton John's "Your Song" for his tribute album Revamp. Later in the year, she starred as a struggling singer named Ally in Bradley Cooper's
                        critically acclaimed film A Star Is Born, a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for A Star Is Born, which she insisted they perform live in the
                        film. Its lead single, "Shallow ", performed by the two, was released in September and has reached number one in Australia, Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK as well as number five in the US. The
                        soundtrack's release coincided with the film's, and it contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs. Gaga also has signed a two-year residency, named Lady Gaga Enigma, to perform at the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas,
                        which is scheduled to begin in December 2018. She has also started working on her sixth studio album.
